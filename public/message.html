            <p>"Convergence the inter Collegiate Mathematics Fest has been a legacy of the Department and 
            as a student coordinator I've seen the potential it holds for creative minds and leaders 
            to come out and express themselves. This year we bring to you a unique blend of events 
            that we feel may inspire each one of you explore and enjoy the world of Mathematics.
            Ladies and Gentlemen, on behalf of my core team, 
            event heads and volunteers I welcome you all to Convergence 2024 
            and I wish you have a wonderful experience!"</p>
